# Polycalc

**Description:**
Polycalc is a small app I created to automate the calculation of certain polygon measurements in math homework using my phone. This is my first full working android app, so feel free to make any suggestions. Feel free to download the apk to use the app!

**Installation(for android phones only):**
Download and open the apk file on your android phone. If you get a popup that says something along the lines of "unknown sources not enabled" go to the security section of your phone's settings and enable applications from unknown sources. Then open the app again and you should be prompted to install.
