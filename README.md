# Polycalc

**Description:**
Polycalc is a small app I created to automate the calculation of certain polygon measurements in math homework using my phone. This is useless to the average person, but *extremely* useful if you're in high school geometry. This is my first full working android app, so feel free to make any optimizations (I'm sure there are many to be made). Also, feel free to download the apk if you happen to be in high school geometry and want to spend less time making repetitive calculations.

**Installation(for android phones only):**
Download and open the apk file on your android phone. If you get a popup that says something along the lines of "unknown sources not enabled" go to the security section of your phone's settings and enable applications from unknown sources. Then open the app again and you should be prompted to install.
